## Fork

*This fork of [ACEmulator](https://github.com/ACEmulator/ACE) with additions by [jkurs](https://github.com/jkurs/ACE/tree/Infinite-Progression) and [Aquafir](https://github.com/aquafir/ACE) will try out experimental content that may be integrated into [ValHeel](https://discord.gg/5QbZDfasdW) or any server that wishes to use it.  Many thanks for all the great work that the community put in!*

When possible modifications and configuration will be added to [ACE.Server\ValHeelMods](https://github.com/Sepultaris/ValHeel).

No guarantees can be made for quality of code, adding a feature, or responding.  This is a project for when I have free time.
